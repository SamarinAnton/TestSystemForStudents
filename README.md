# TestSystemForStudents

## tasks:
* Find information about JpaRepository and CrudRepository, that difference between them?!
    * we don't know, but we use JpaRepository, maybe JpaRepository provides more functionality!
* We have a problem in WebController,  save User in DB throwing exception about nullable value
    * this is problem is solved! We can save Student and Teacher entity in DB, but DB in table "users" contain fields for students and teacher this should not have been!
* We can add lesson in DB, but we are can't check an unique subject! And we have a problem with adding task in DB (error in SQL syntax)
